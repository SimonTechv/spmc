![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b91d697-fb38-45d1-9b32-2ad52f770ce8)

**How to build?**
1. Install arm-gcc-none-eabi & python3 (add to PATH)
2. Clone this repo
3. From project root directory execute .bat files: scripts/configure.bat & scripts/build.bat
4. Result .bin & .hex & .elf files created in build directory

**What is this?**
1. This is high efficient energy harvesing module for your DIY projects (ideal for environmental monitoring applications.)
2. Module based on the Texas Instruments BQ25570RGR. It is an ultra-low-power energy harvester power management IC designed to efficiently extract and manage microwatts (ÂµW) to milliwatts (mW) of power from various high-impedance DC energy sources. (Photovoltaic (Solar) Cells, Thermal Electric Generators (TEGs), Piezoelectric Generators e.t.c...)
3. Also, the module contains: eeprom memory, light sensor, low-power microcontroller, pressure and height sensor, voltage converter. Also planned is a revision with a lightning discharge sensor, accelerometer-gyroscope, radio transmitting module.
